Choosing the Hash Function

Sri Harsha Pasupuleti

The project is to design and implement an algorithm related to hashtables. This project is about reading a large number of the distinct product of numbers, i.e., seven digits each from the input data that has given in the text files. Our goal is to decide which digit among the seven provides the best-balanced storage of the items. The expected output should display the result of passing all the test cases included in the file main.cpp.

Feed the input files as .txt format in the code that parses the data to get the desired output.

We have used Java as a programming language to code and did our best to bring C++ craftmanship.
